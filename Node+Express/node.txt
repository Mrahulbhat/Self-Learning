Introduction:
- Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment. It is a popular tool for almost any kind of project!
- Node.js runs the V8 JavaScript engine, the core of Google Chrome, outside of the browser. This allows Node.js to be very performant.
- It runs in a single process (single thread) and doesnot create a new thread for every single request.
- Asyncronous in nature and hence doesnot get affected get blocked.

Uses:
- File system access: Provides API's to read and write files directly (which is not possible in browser for security reasons).
- Server side Capabilities: Node js enables JS to run on the server, handle Http requests, file operations, and other server side functionalities.
- Modules: Organize code into modules which can be reused using require().

Features removed in Node.js ❌ :
- Window object.
- DOM manipulation.
- BOM features like navigation etc.
- Web specific API's: Local Storage, Session storage, Cookies.

JavaScript on Web Server: 🚀
- Database Management: Crud operations.
- Authentication, Authorization.
- Input Validation.
- Session Management.
- API Management.
- Error Handling.
- Security measures.
- Data Encryption.
- Logging and Monitoring.
- Real Time Data Apps: like chat apps and live updates, using WebSockets.

JavaScript is also used to make Build Tools: Powers build processes for front-end tech using tools like Webpack, etc.

Server Architecture with Node.js: 🚀
- User/Device: Web page -> Browser -> Device(user).
- Frontend/Client-Side (HTML,CSS,JS,REACT,etc) : This is sent as Web page to the user device.
- Backend/Server-Side (Node.js).

Node.js Server: 
- Create server and listen to incoming requests.
- Validation, DB connection, data processing.
- return response in form of HTML, JSON, CSS, JS.

How DNS Works? 🚀
-> Domain Name System: Imagine a container which stores a domain with a Address.
-> How will we search Google.com , we will type it rather than 87.222.xxxxx...

Example: 
Where is google.com? => Now it checks in DNS and returns the address => Now, it will go to that address to access google.com.

Exact working: 
1. Domain Name Entry: User searches/types a domain (www.google.com) into browser.
2. DNS Query: Browser send a DNS query.
3. DNS Server: Returns the correct IP address of that domain.
4. Browser Connects: The browser uses the IP to connect to the web server and loads the website.


But to be very precise:
1. Root DNS: It is starting point for DNS resolution. It connects to correct TLD server (.com, .org) etc.
2. TLD DNS (Top level Domain): Handles queries for specific top level domains (.com, .net) and directs them to the authoritative DNS server.
3. Authoritative DNS: contains actual IP address of the domain and returns this IP address as answer to the query.

=======================================================================================================

How Web Works?
1. Client Request initiation: Client enters the url in browser hence initiates a network call.
2. DNS Resolution: The browser contacts a DNS server to get IP address of the domain.
3. TCP connection: The browser establishes a TCP connection with the server's IP address.
4. HTTP Request: The browser sends a HTTP request to the server.
5. Server processing: The server processes the request and prepares a response.
6. HTTP Response: The server sends a HTTP response back to the client.
7. Network Transmission: The response travels back to the client.
8. Client Recieves Response: Browser recieves and interprets the response.
9. Rendering: The browser renders the content of the response and displays to the user.

HTTP VS HTTPS Protocol:
Http: Hyper text transfer protocol: 
- Facilitates communication btw a web browser and a server.
- Sends data in plain text (no encryption).
- Used for basic website browsing without security

HTTPS: Http Secure:
- Secure version of Http.
- Encrypts data for secure communication (middle data is encrypted so no one can attack).
- Use SSL/TSL to encrypt data.
- Used in online banking, e-commerce.

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):
- Ensures reliable connection before data is transferred.

=======================================================================================================

Node Core Modules: 🚀
- Built-in: Core modules are included with Node.js installation.
- No installation needed: directly used without npm install.
- Performance: High performace with good speed.

1. fs (File System): Handles file operations like reading and wrtiting files.
2. HTTP, HTTPS
3. path: Provides utilities for handling and transforming file.
4. path.os: Provides OS related utility methods and properties
5. events: Handles events and event driven programming.
6. cryto: Provides crypto fn like hashing and encryption.
7. url: Pastes and formats URL strings. 

=======================================================================================================

require() ?
- Imports modules in Node.js.
- Caching: Modules are catched until server closes.
- Node.js searches for modules in core, node_modules and the file paths.

syntax: const <name> = require('module'); // no need of .js extention
Ex: const http = require('http);

=======================================================================================================

Creating Node Server: 🚀

const http = require('http');

 const server = http.createServer((req,res)=>{
    console.log(req);
 });

 const port = 3000;

 server.listen(port, () => {
    console.log('Server running on port: '+ port);
 });

//server established.

=======================================================================================================

Request and Response 🚀

* Node Lifecycle and Event Loop:

Request => NODE SERVER => [ DB / FILESYSTEM/ NETWORK ETC]

Node Server: contains Event Queue => Event Loop => Thread Pool.

Each pool in thread pool is used to perform single task. One guy will do db work, one fs work etc. using callbacks.
Event Loop listens to event coming from Event Queue and gives to thread pool.

====================================================================================

NPM INIT COMMAND: 🚀

- Node package manager

npm init:

Output is a package.json file: with app.js as entry point, name of package is npm-test

{
  "name": "npm-test",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "app.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "description": ""
}

====================================================================================

NPM INSTALL COMMAND: is used to install dependencies contained in package.json.

npm install <package-name>

-save : Adds the package to the project's dependencies in package.json.
-save-dev: Adds the package to the project's devDependencies in the package.json.
-g: Installs the package globally, mkaing it available to entire system, not just for a particular project.
-save-exact: Installs the exact version specified without updating for newer versions.
-force: Forces npm to fetch and install packages even after the packages are already installed.

NOTE: -save-dev: This saves space and uses only in development.
Do this only when you need something during dev and not in production.
EX: Testing frameworks, build tools, etc.

Nodemon [ npm install nodemon --save-dev ]

When i install nodemon, it also installs its req dependencies.
Ex: If i bring SRK actor, he will carry his gym trainer, barber etc along with him.
It will be stored in node_modules folder

====================================================================================

ERRORS AND DEBUGGING:

Types of errors:

- Syntax error: Basic errors in syntax in our code (missing semicolon etc).
- Logical error: Code runs but produces incorrect results due to faulty logic (wrong formula).
- Runtime error: Errors which occurs during runtime due to faulty code.


example for runtime errors:

let num = 10;
num(); //type error

Debugging (Start Debugging): It executes code line by line and displays output accordingly.
